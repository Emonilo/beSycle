Using Netlify

Netlify is a popular choice for hosting static sites and serverless functions. It offers continuous deployment from Git across all of its plans, including the free tier.

    Build your React app: Run npm run build in your React project directory. This command creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
    Push your code to GitHub (if it's not already there).
    Connect Netlify to your GitHub repo:
        Sign up/log in to Netlify.
        Click on "New site from Git" and select GitHub.
        Choose the repository with your React app.
        Configure the build options. For a CRA app, the build command is npm run build, and the publish directory is build/.
        Click on "Deploy site".

Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site on every commit to the connected repository.
Using Vercel

Vercel is another excellent platform for deploying React applications, offering similar features to Netlify.
